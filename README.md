## Guide to this repository

**Code Used** contains the two python notebook files on which the analysis was performed as well at the R file used to further analyse and visualise the data

**Joint Images for Thesis** contains the images used in the final thesis.

**Raw CSV Results** contains the raw csv files generated by using code from the two python notebook files. This is the data that was used to generate results and further analysed in R.

**Run Accessions.xlsx** contains all the run accessions from the European Nucleotide Archive. These are all the runs/data sets that were used in the final project. Keep in mind that some runs found in Raw CSV Results were not used in the final project, only this file shows what has been used.
